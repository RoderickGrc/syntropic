## ‚ú® Key Features

Syntropic is packed with features designed to streamline your AI-powered development workflow:

*   üå≤ **Intuitive Tree Explorer:** Get a clean, hierarchical view of your current workspace right in the sidebar. Effortlessly navigate through your project's structure.

*   üéØ **Precision Prompt Control:** Don't just send everything. Interactively check the files and folders you want to include. Syntropic gives you granular control over the context you provide to the LLM.

*   üìö **Beyond Code: Full PDF Support:** Seamlessly include PDF documents in your prompt. Perfect for referencing technical documentation, academic papers, or project specifications alongside your code.

*   üìÑ **Universal File Compatibility:** If it's a plain text file, Syntropic can handle it. From source code in any language (`.js`, `.py`, `.rs`, `.go`) to configuration files (`.json`, `.yaml`, `.toml`) and markdown (`.md`), it's all ready to be included.

*   üìä **Real-time Token Counting:** Know your context size before you send it! Syntropic uses `tiktoken` to provide an accurate token count of your selected files, helping you manage costs and stay within the LLM's context window.

*   ‚úÇÔ∏è **Smart Filtering & Blacklisting:** Automatically hide clutter like `node_modules`, `.git`, and build folders. Keep your explorer focused on what matters with a fully configurable blacklist.

*   üöÄ **Instant Prompt Generation:** With a single click, Syntropic consolidates your selected file structure and contents into a clean, formatted prompt, ready to be copied and pasted into your favorite AI chat interface.
